In this proyect I set up a <a href="sakaloner.github.io">prototype web application</a> to create 'watch later' lists of content using html, css and the javascript framework vue.js.
This proyect is motivated by faults I have observed in content organizers like Pocket and Instapaper. My main concern is that this applications sort the content their users save to watch later simply by chronological order. I found this to be a mistake since it should be sorted, in my opinion, by how much the user wants to see the content that was saved. The lack of this characteristics is why i dont find very useful content organizer as the mentiones below and why i wanted to make this prototype of a webpage with that feature.
