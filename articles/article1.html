I am using the openai library for python to create a chatbot class where the functionality of the chatgpt reponsse is set up. This files lives in the brain folder with the functions since i am using the gpt models with function calling implemented. The tlbot.py is where the telegram bot lives, and for this i am using the python telegram bot library. The database library is where the two modes of data storage lives, a sqlite database and an embedding database provided by the chromadb library live. The sql is for storing data intentionally, the chroma databse is for storing past bot and user messages, and also for retrieving them. The bot can scheduled messages to send at an specific date or at a certain interval, this is provided by the apscheduler library.

* Story
In the year 2023, amidst the expansive realm of artificial intelligence (AI) development, significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) and image synthesis are revolutionizing the course of human history. This unprecedented surge in progress hints at a profound paradigm shift, with AI possibly transcending beyond a mere milestone to become an unparalleled phenomenon. Although I could extensively present a multitude of arguments substantiating this claim, I shall give the world time to speak for itself. Let it be known, however, that in recent years, humanity has made unparalleled breakthroughs in the realms of intelligence, potentially paving the way for the creation of a self-improving, superior machine. Such an achievement, undoubtedly, would forever alter the landscape of our world (read this if you are interested in how it might change the world )

Even if we are conservative to a fault and assume that all AI progress somehow has reached a plateau in its current state, the immense value residing within LLMs still remains undeniable. A symbiotic relationship between humans and these extraordinary models is all but inevitable, accentuating the unique attributes possessed by each party. LLMs offer unparalleled computational prowess, vast storage capacity, and the absence of bodily constraints, while humans bring to the table their embodiment and consciousness. This merging of minds, akin to a digital second brain, will be dawn of a new species that the face of earth has never seen before.

Driven by my desire to contribute to this transformation and capitalize on existing advancements, I have interconnected a Telegram bot with the GPT api with some databases. These implementations serve as my own means of harnessing the power of ChatGPT for diverse practical applications. It allows me to explore ease of use, problem-solving capabilities, and the limitations of these models. Utilizing a pre-existing framework like Langchain seemed overly precise and abstract, for all abstractions are inherently unappealing and futile, unless they originate from one's own mind. My intent was to learn the intricacies of ChatGPT through varied approaches and experimentation, unhindered by excessive abstractions.

This ongoing journey continually evolves. I shall diligently update this repository with notable and practical discoveries, encompassing new models and any other developments that arise. Your valuable contributions are also welcome! By coding and integrating commendable functionalities, you may contribute to this endeavor and make your own pull requests.
