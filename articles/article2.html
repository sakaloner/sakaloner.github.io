<p>Title: Listapp: attention is all we have</p>
<p>This is projects is for a webpage where users can save content references and also explore the content of their friends. It is like a digital library for all types of media (podcasts, videos, music, articles, books, tweets).</p>
<ul>
<li>The back end comprises a FastAPI framework based Python server and a Docker-based PostgreSQL database for straightforward deployment.</li>
<li>The front end was initially vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Over time, it evolved into a working prototype using Vue.js, and now the final product is crafted with React.js.</li>
<li>The Chrome extension is developed with vanilla JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>** story:
&quot;seize the means of production information flow&quot; - karl marx communist manifest.</p>
<p>I have been interested for sometime now in soemthing i would call &quot;systematization of information flows&quot;. Somewhere where this interest presented itself was my extensive habit of reading online material. I have a lot of places from where good writing might come from: friend recommendations, blogs, twitter, among others. However, the mood for reading and the process of finding good material to read dont happen contiguosly. I lamented the lack of a comprehensible solution for saving areticles for later consumtion. Although platforms like Pocket, myMind or Instapaper offer a semblance of this service, I envisioned a more extensive tool, allowing users not only to save information for future use, but classify it, rate it, and train a personal algorithm with it. I imagined a personal digital library for all digital content.</p>
<p>Our mind is made to a great extent by the things we feed it with. Now that theres so much information in the world i find it very important to create systems so we feed ourselves with things that makes us better human beings. I find this is one of the most important problems of our time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we humans are somewhat flawed in making the best choices for ourselves. Our attention can easily be exploited, and technology companies are investing significant energy in doing just that. These companies focus predominantly on maximising the time users spend on their platforms rather than the impact of the consumed content on these users. An excellent example is Tinder, which benefits more from users perpetually engaging in casual relationships than from users finding their lasting loving relationships.</p>
<p>With my growing recognition of the importance of algorithms for the future of mankind, I thought, why not develop a platform not only for saving and retrieving content but also for discovering new content?</p>
<p>This idea transformed ListApp not only into a comprehensive aggregator of links with tagsâ€”capturing videos, articles, books, tweets, music, and podcasts but a proper social media application. Other people act like compression nodes of interests, so it adds to the recommendation algorithm content not added by the user themeselves but that might really interest them.</p>
<p>When i got into a place of development where i had all the main feautures i was ready to launch. But wait i worked so long in this stuff and how do i show it to people? that was actually the hard part. I fell into the common trap of &quot;spending a lot of time working on something that nobody wants&quot;. I could have maybe created a much simpler prototype and distribute a little to some people to get some feedback about if they would care for this product, thats the reasonable thing to do. I didnt really want to be reasonable, i had an unreasonable urge to finisht he project and confidence in that i was doing something good by doing it, even if wasnt used by anyone i would have stilled learned something.</p>
<p>Moreover, I found myself questioning my approach. For example i was not sure if the platform i had built, an agreggator, was robust enough since it depends on other platforms to function. Also i got interested in other approaches to the problem, for example the Atproto protocol where the content is hosted by a federation of computers, allowing to save content directly in the protocol, mantaining descentralization, and being agnostic with the forntend implementation of the protocol. Maybe the right platform to get algorithm soverignety would one where video, audio, and text content could be saved and shared, something like a a mega internet structure.</p>
<p>I also have other concernes about the UI. I didnt feel satisfied enoguht with the existing interface, not only because i didnt pay a lot attention to aesthetics, but because of its functionality. In the project I used a basic Chrome extension for quick content saving. A more innovative and maybe better approach could be a Large Language Model bot serving as a user interface, where users could save content and receive recommendations via simple text. Despite these considerations, I was uncertain about the best approach to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>So yeah, in conclusion i couldnt really distribute it well, i was unsure of my approach to solve the problem of algorithmic autonomy, and honestly i got very discouraged that nobody wanted to use the thing i had worked so hard on!</p>
<p>Anyways i learned a lot from this project. I not only tought direct things myself how to create a website, both its abckedn and front ends, how to host it in a cloud computing service, but i also learned about how to work hard and maximize time, how to understand new libraries, how to ask for help and how to research.
I find it funny that i didnt know about gpt at this time. I probably could have finished the project way earlier but i might have not get so much resilience from breaking my head alone with the problems i found.</p>
